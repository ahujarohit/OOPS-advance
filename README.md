**Mastering OOPS - Advance in Java**

Welcome to "Mastering OOPS - Advance in Java"!  
In this series, we dive deep into advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, building on the foundations covered in our previous series. Whether you're preparing for job interviews, brushing up on core concepts, or seeking to take your Java programming skills to the next level, this series is designed for you.

What you'll learn:
1. **Default Values of Variables**: Understand the default values of local and instance variables in Java, setting the stage for more complex concepts.
2. **Relationships in Java (HAS A and IS A)**: Explore the essential relationships between classes, such as composition and inheritance, and how they shape object-oriented design.
3. **Instanceof and ClassCastException**: Learn how to use the `instanceof` operator and handle `ClassCastException` to ensure safe typecasting in polymorphic scenarios.
4. **Polymorphic Calls with Examples**: Dive into polymorphism, one of the pillars of OOP, with practical examples of polymorphic method calls.
5. **Overriding and Overloading**: Master the difference between method overriding and overloading, along with legal return types for overridden methods.
6. **Constructors**: A comprehensive guide to constructors in Java, including their role in object initialization and method overloading.
7. **Coupling and Cohesion**: Discover the key design principles of coupling and cohesion to write clean, maintainable code.
8. **Inner Classes**: Get an in-depth look at the different types of inner classes in Java, including:
   - Block Local Inner Classes
   - Method Local Inner Classes
   - Anonymous Inner Classes
   - Member Inner Classes
   - Static Inner Classes
9. **Garbage Collector in Java**: Gain insights into Java's automatic memory management with the garbage collector, along with practical examples to understand its working.

Each topic is explained with real-world examples, ensuring you gain a practical understanding of advanced OOP concepts. This series is packed with interview questions, tips, and coding challenges to help you apply what you've learned.
